---

**Note: GravityView now requires PHP 5.3 or newer**

_This is a major release. Please back up your site before updating._ We have tested the plugin thoroughly, but we suggest backing up your site before updating all plugins.

**New functionality**

* `[gventry]`: embed entries in a post, page or a View ([learn more](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/462-gvfield-embed-gravity-forms-field-values))
* `[gvfield]`: embed single field values ([learn more](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/462-gvfield-embed-gravity-forms-field-values))
* [Many new Merge Tag modifiers](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/350-merge-tag-modifiers) - These enable powerful new abilities when using the Custom Content field!
* Use oEmbed with Custom Content fields - easily embed YouTube videos, Tweets (and much more) on your Custom Content field
* "Is Starred" field - display whether an entry is "Starred" in Gravity Forms or not, and star/unstar it from the front end of your site
* Added Bosnian, Iranian, and Canadian French translations, updated many others (thank you all!)

**Smaller changes**

* Added `{gv_entry_link}` Merge Tag, alias of `[gv_entry_link]` shortcode in `{gv_entry_link:[post id]:[action]}` format. This allows you to use `{gv_entry_link}` inside HTML tags, where you are not able to use the `[gv_entry_link]` shortcode.
* Default `[gvlogic]` comparison is now set to `isnot=""`; this way, you can just use `[gvlogic if="{example:1}"]` instead of `[gvlogic if="{example:1}" isnot=""]` to check if a field has a value.

**Developer Updates**

This release is the biggest ever for developers! Even so, we have taken great care to provide backward compatibility with GravityView 1.x. Other than increasing the minimum version of PHP to 5.3, **no breaking changes were made.**

* We have rewritten the plugin from the ground up. [Learn all about it here](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/wiki/The-Future-of-GravityView).
* New REST API! Fetch GravityView details and entries using the WordPress REST API endpoint. It's disabled by default, but can be enabled or disabled globally on GravityView Settings screen, or per-View in View Settings. [Learn about the endpoints](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/wiki/REST-API).
* New `gravityview()` API wrapper function, now used for easy access to everything you could want
* New template structure ([learn how to migrate your custom template files](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/wiki/Template-Migration))
* We have gotten rid of global state; actions and filters are now passed a `$context` argument, a [`\GV\Template_Context` object](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/blob/2.0/future/includes/class-gv-context-template.php)
* When HTML 5 is enabled in Gravity Forms, now the Search All field will use `type="search"`
* _Countless_ new filters and actions! Additional documentation will be coming, both on [docs.gravityview.co](https://docs.gravityview.co) as well as [codex.gravityview.co](https://codex.gravityview.co).

A special thanks to [Gennady](https://codeseekah.com) for your tireless pursuit of better code, insistence on backward compatibility, and your positive attitude. üëè

__Developer Notes__

* Modified: `gravityview_get_forms()` function and `GVCommon::get_forms()` method to be compatible with `GFAPI::get_forms()`. Now accepts `$active` and `$trash` arguments, as well as returning all form data (not just `id` and `title` keys)

* Modified: Don't convert underscores to periods if not numeric in `GravityView_Widget_Search::prepare_field_filter()` - this fixes searching entry meta

* Modified: HTML tags are now stripped from Email field body and subject content
* Modified: Moved `GravityView_Admin_View_Item`, `GravityView_Admin_View_Field`, and `GravityView_Admin_View_Widget` to their own files

	- Edit Entry now supports Conditional Logic - as expected, fields will show and hide based on the form configuration

	- If visiting an invalid Edit Entry link, you are now provided with a back link

    * See "Matching blank values" in the [shortcode documentation](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode)
* Fixed: Sorting by full address. Now defaults to sorting by city. Use the `gravityview/sorting/address` filter to modify what data to use ([here's how](https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/8b8f296c6f7dc99d227d))
* Fixed: Newly created entries cannot be directly accessed when using the custom slug feature
* Fixed: Merge Tag autocomplete hidden behind the Field settings (did you know you can type `{` in a field that has Merge Tags enabled and you will get autocomplete?)
* Fixed: For sites not using [Permalinks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks), the Search Bar was not working for embedded Views

* Added: [Using the Shortcode](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/73-using-the-shortcode) help article
* Added: Data Source added to the Views page
* Fixed: Field labels escaping issue (`It's an Example` was displaying as `It\'s an Example`)
* Fixed: Settings "gear" not showing when adding a new field
* Fixed: Sorting issues
	- Remove the option to sort by composite fields like Name, Address, Product; Gravity Forms doesn't process those sort requests properly
	- Remove List and Paragraph fields from being sortable
	- Known bug: Price fields are sorted alphabetically, not numerically. For example, given $20,000, $2,000 and $20, Gravity Forms will sort the array like this: $2,000, $20, $20,000. We've filed a bug report with Gravity Forms.
* Improved: Added visibility toggles to some Field Settings. For example, if the "Show Label" setting is not checked, then the "Custom Label" setting is hidden.
* Modified how data is sent to the template: removed the magic methods getter/setters setting the `$var` variable - not data is stored directly as object parameters.
* Added many translations. Thanks everyone!
