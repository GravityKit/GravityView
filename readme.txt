* Updated: Turkish translation (thanks [@suhakaralar](https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/suhakaralar/)!) and Mexican translation (thanks [@jorgepelaez](https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/jorgepelaez/)!)

= 1.10.1 on July 2 =
* Fixed: Edit Entry link and Delete Entry link in embedded Views go to default view url
* Fixed: Duplicated fields on the Edit Entry view
* Fixed: Warning on bulk edit

= 1.10 on June 26 =
* Update: Due to the new Edit Entry functionality, GravityView now requires Gravity Forms 1.9 or higher
* Fixed: Editing Hidden fields restored
* Fixed: Edit Entry and Delete Entry may not always show in embedded Views
* Fixed: Search Bar "Clear" button Javascript warning in Internet Explorer
* Fixed: Edit Entry styling issues with input sizes. Edit Entry now uses 100% Gravity Forms styles.
* Added: `[gv_edit_entry_link]` and `[gv_delete_entry_link]` shortcodes. [Read how to use them](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/287-edit-entry-and-delete-entry-shortcodes)

= 1.9.1 on June 24 =
* Fixed: Allow "Admin Only" fields to appear in Edit Entry form
	- New behavior: If the Edit Entry tab isn't configured in GravityView (which means all fields will be shown by default), GravityView will hide "Admin Only" fields from being edited by non-administrators. If the Edit Entry tab is configured, then GravityView will use the field settings in the configuration, overriding Gravity Forms settings.
* Tweak: Changed `gravityview/edit-entry/hide-product-fields` filter to `gravityview/edit_entry/hide-product-fields` for consistency

= 1.9 on June 23 =
* Added: Edit Entry now takes place in the Gravity Forms form layout, not in the previous layout. This means:
	- Edit Entry now supports Conditional Logic - as expected, fields will show and hide based on the form configuration
	- Edit Entry supports [Gravity Forms CSS Ready Classes](https://www.gravityhelp.com/css-ready-classes-for-gravity-forms/) - the layout you have configured for your form will be used for Edit Entry, too.
	- If you customized the CSS of your Edit Entry layout, **you will need to update your stylesheet**. Sorry for the inconvenience!
	- If visiting an invalid Edit Entry link, you are now provided with a back link
	- Product fields are now hidden by default, since they aren't editable. If you want to instead display the old message that "product fields aren't editable," you can show them using the new `gravityview/edit_entry/hide-product-fields` filter
* Added: Define column widths for fields in each field's settings (for Table and DataTable View Types only)
* Added: `{created_by}` Merge Tag that displays information from the creator of the entry ([learn more](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/281-the-createdby-merge-tag))
* Added: Edit Entry field setting to open link in new tab/window
* Added: CSS classes to the Update/Cancel/Delete buttons ([learn more](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/63-css-guide#edit-entry))
* Fixed: Shortcodes not processing properly in DataTables Extension
* Tweak: Changed support widget to a Live Chat customer support and feedback form widget

* Fixed: Error on `list-single.php` template

= 1.8.1 on June 9 =
* Added: New search filter for Date fields to allow searching over date ranges ("from X to Y")
* Updated: The minimum required version of Gravity Forms is now 1.8.7. **GravityView will be requiring Gravity Forms 1.9 soon.** Please update Gravity Forms if you are running an older version!
* Fixed: Conflicts with [A-Z Filter Extension](https://gravityview.co/extensions/a-z-filter/) and View sorting due to wrong field mapping
* Fixed: The "links" field type on the GravityView WordPress search widget was opening the wrong page

* Added: Custom Link Text in Website fields
* Added: Poll Addon GravityView widget
* Added: Quiz Addon support: add Quiz score fields to your View configuration
* Added: Possibility to search by entry creator on Search Bar and Widget
* Fixed: `[gvlogic]` shortcode now properly handles comparing empty values.
    * Use `[gvlogic if="{example} is=""]` to determine if a value is blank.
    * Use `[gvlogic if="{example} isnot=""]` to determine if a value is not blank.
    * See "Matching blank values" in the [shortcode documentation](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode)
* Fixed: Sorting by full address. Now defaults to sorting by city. Use the `gravityview/sorting/address` filter to modify what data to use ([here's how](https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/8b8f296c6f7dc99d227d))
* Fixed: Newly created entries cannot be directly accessed when using the custom slug feature
* Fixed: Merge Tag autocomplete hidden behind the Field settings (did you know you can type `{` in a field that has Merge Tags enabled and you will get autocomplete?)
* Fixed: For sites not using [Permalinks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks), the Search Bar was not working for embedded Views
* Tweak: When GravityView is disabled, only show "Could not activate the Extension; GravityView is not active." on the Plugins page
* Tweak: Added third parameter to `gravityview_widget_search_filters` filter that passes the search widget arguments
