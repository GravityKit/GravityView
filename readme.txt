	- Thickbox is no longer used
	- Modify settings using `gravityview/lightbox/provider/fancybox/settings`
	- [See options available here](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/docs/#options)
	- If you prefer, a [Featherlight lightbox option is available](https://github.com/gravityview/gv-snippets/tree/addon/featherlight-lightbox)
	- Easily add support for your own lightbox script by extending the new `GravityView_Lightbox_Provider` abstract class (the [Featherbox lightbox script](https://github.com/gravityview/gv-snippets/tree/addon/featherlight-lightbox) is a good example).
	- Modified: Formally deprecated the mis-spelled `gravity_view_lightbox_script` and `gravity_view_lightbox_style` filters in favor of  `gravityview_lightbox_script` and `gravityview_lightbox_style` (finally!)

* Breaking CSS change: Removed `.gv-list-view` CSS class from the List layout container `<div>`. The CSS class was also used in the looped entry containers, making it hard to style. This issue was introduced in GravityView 2.0. For background, see [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/issues/1026).

= 2.9.4 on January 25, 2021 =

	- Note: For existing Views, if both "Open link in the same window?" and "Open link in a new tab or window?" settings were checked, the link will now _not open in a new tab_. We hope no one had them both checked; this would have caused a rift in space-time and a room full of dark-matter rainbows.

\- Zack with GravityView

---

**Note: GravityView now requires PHP 5.3 or newer**

_This is a major release. Please back up your site before updating._ We have tested the plugin thoroughly, but we suggest backing up your site before updating all plugins.

**New functionality**

* `[gventry]`: embed entries in a post, page or a View ([learn more](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/462-gvfield-embed-gravity-forms-field-values))
* `[gvfield]`: embed single field values ([learn more](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/462-gvfield-embed-gravity-forms-field-values))
* [Many new Merge Tag modifiers](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/350-merge-tag-modifiers) - These enable powerful new abilities when using the Custom Content field!
* Use oEmbed with Custom Content fields - easily embed YouTube videos, Tweets (and much more) on your Custom Content field
* "Is Starred" field - display whether an entry is "Starred" in Gravity Forms or not, and star/unstar it from the front end of your site
* Added Bosnian, Iranian, and Canadian French translations, updated many others (thank you all!)

**Smaller changes**

* Added `{gv_entry_link}` Merge Tag, alias of `[gv_entry_link]` shortcode in `{gv_entry_link:[post id]:[action]}` format. This allows you to use `{gv_entry_link}` inside HTML tags, where you are not able to use the `[gv_entry_link]` shortcode.
* Default `[gvlogic]` comparison is now set to `isnot=""`; this way, you can just use `[gvlogic if="{example:1}"]` instead of `[gvlogic if="{example:1}" isnot=""]` to check if a field has a value.

**Developer Updates**

This release is the biggest ever for developers! Even so, we have taken great care to provide backward compatibility with GravityView 1.x. Other than increasing the minimum version of PHP to 5.3, **no breaking changes were made.**

* We have rewritten the plugin from the ground up. [Learn all about it here](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/wiki/The-Future-of-GravityView).
* New REST API! Fetch GravityView details and entries using the WordPress REST API endpoint. It's disabled by default, but can be enabled or disabled globally on GravityView Settings screen, or per-View in View Settings. [Learn about the endpoints](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/wiki/REST-API).
* New `gravityview()` API wrapper function, now used for easy access to everything you could want
* New template structure ([learn how to migrate your custom template files](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/wiki/Template-Migration))
* We have gotten rid of global state; actions and filters are now passed a `$context` argument, a [`\GV\Template_Context` object](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/blob/v2.0/future/includes/class-gv-context-template.php)
* When HTML 5 is enabled in Gravity Forms, now the Search All field will use `type="search"`
* _Countless_ new filters and actions! Additional documentation will be coming, both on [docs.gravityview.co](https://docs.gravityview.co) as well as [codex.gravityview.co](https://codex.gravityview.co).

A special thanks to [Gennady](https://codeseekah.com) for your tireless pursuit of better code, insistence on backward compatibility, and your positive attitude. ��

= 1.10.1 on July 2 =
* Fixed: Edit Entry link and Delete Entry link in embedded Views go to default view url
* Fixed: Duplicated fields on the Edit Entry view
* Fixed: Warning on bulk edit

= 1.10 on June 26 =
* Update: Due to the new Edit Entry functionality, GravityView now requires Gravity Forms 1.9 or higher
* Fixed: Editing Hidden fields restored
* Fixed: Edit Entry and Delete Entry may not always show in embedded Views
* Fixed: Search Bar "Clear" button Javascript warning in Internet Explorer
* Fixed: Edit Entry styling issues with input sizes. Edit Entry now uses 100% Gravity Forms styles.
* Added: `[gv_edit_entry_link]` and `[gv_delete_entry_link]` shortcodes. [Read how to use them](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/287-edit-entry-and-delete-entry-shortcodes)

= 1.9.1 on June 24 =
* Fixed: Allow "Admin Only" fields to appear in Edit Entry form
	- New behavior: If the Edit Entry tab isn't configured in GravityView (which means all fields will be shown by default), GravityView will hide "Admin Only" fields from being edited by non-administrators. If the Edit Entry tab is configured, then GravityView will use the field settings in the configuration, overriding Gravity Forms settings.
* Tweak: Changed `gravityview/edit-entry/hide-product-fields` filter to `gravityview/edit_entry/hide-product-fields` for consistency

= 1.9 on June 23 =
* Added: Edit Entry now takes place in the Gravity Forms form layout, not in the previous layout. This means:
	- Edit Entry now supports Conditional Logic - as expected, fields will show and hide based on the form configuration
	- Edit Entry supports [Gravity Forms CSS Ready Classes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/list-of-css-ready-classes/) - the layout you have configured for your form will be used for Edit Entry, too.
	- If you customized the CSS of your Edit Entry layout, **you will need to update your stylesheet**. Sorry for the inconvenience!
	- If visiting an invalid Edit Entry link, you are now provided with a back link
	- Product fields are now hidden by default, since they aren't editable. If you want to instead display the old message that "product fields aren't editable," you can show them using the new `gravityview/edit_entry/hide-product-fields` filter
* Added: Define column widths for fields in each field's settings (for Table and DataTable View Types only)
* Added: `{created_by}` Merge Tag that displays information from the creator of the entry ([learn more](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/281-the-createdby-merge-tag))
* Added: Edit Entry field setting to open link in new tab/window
* Added: CSS classes to the Update/Cancel/Delete buttons ([learn more](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/63-css-guide#edit-entry))

* Tweak: Changed support widget to a Live Chat customer support and feedback form widget

* Fixed: Conflicts with [A-Z Filter Extension](https://gravityview.co/extensions/a-z-filter/) and View sorting due to wrong field mapping
* Fixed: The "links" field type on the GravityView WordPress search widget was opening the wrong page

* Added: Possibility to search by entry creator on Search Bar and Widget
* Fixed: `[gvlogic]` shortcode now properly handles comparing empty values.
    * Use `[gvlogic if="{example} is=""]` to determine if a value is blank.
    * Use `[gvlogic if="{example} isnot=""]` to determine if a value is not blank.
    * See "Matching blank values" in the [shortcode documentation](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode)
* Fixed: Sorting by full address. Now defaults to sorting by city. Use the `gravityview/sorting/address` filter to modify what data to use ([here's how](https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/8b8f296c6f7dc99d227d))
* Fixed: Newly created entries cannot be directly accessed when using the custom slug feature
* Fixed: Merge Tag autocomplete hidden behind the Field settings (did you know you can type `{` in a field that has Merge Tags enabled and you will get autocomplete?)
* Fixed: For sites not using [Permalinks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks), the Search Bar was not working for embedded Views
* Tweak: When GravityView is disabled, only show "Could not activate the Extension; GravityView is not active." on the Plugins page
