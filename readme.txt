	- Remove List and Paragraph fields from being sortable

* Improved: Added visibility toggles to some Field Settings. For example, if the "Show Label" setting is not checked, then the "Custom Label" setting is hidden.
* Modified how data is sent to the template: removed the magic methods getter/setters setting the `$var` variable - not data is stored directly as object parameters.
