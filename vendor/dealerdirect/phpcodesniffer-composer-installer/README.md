This composer installer plugin allows for easy installation of [PHP_CodeSniffer][codesniffer] coding standards (rulesets).

No more symbolic linking of directories, checking out repositories on specific locations or changing
the `phpcs` configuration.

_Note: This plugin is compatible with both version 2.x and 3.x of_ [PHP_CodeSniffer][codesniffer]

## Usage

Installation can be done with [composer], by requiring this package as a development dependency:

```bash
composer require --dev dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer
```

That's it.

### How it works

Basically, this plugin executes the following steps:

- This plugin search for `phpcodesniffer-standard` packages in all of your currently installed Composer packages.
- Matching packages and the project itself are scanned for PHP_CodeSniffer rulesets.
- The plugin will call PHP_CodeSniffer and configure the `installed_paths` option.

### Example project

The following is an example Composer project and has included
multiple `phpcodesniffer-standard` packages.

```json
{
    "name": "dealerdirect/example-project",
    "description": "Just an example project",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {},
    "require-dev": {
        "dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer": "*",
        "object-calisthenics/phpcs-calisthenics-rules": "*",
        "phpcompatibility/php-compatibility": "*",
        "wp-coding-standards/wpcs": "*"
    }
}
```

After running `composer install` PHP_CodeSniffer just works:

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpcs -i
The installed coding standards are MySource, PEAR, PSR1, PSR2, Squiz, Zend, PHPCompatibility, WordPress,
WordPress-Core, WordPress-Docs, WordPress-Extra and WordPress-VIP
```

### Calling the plugin directly

In some circumstances, it is desirable to call this plugin's functionality
directly. For instance, during development or in [CI][definition-ci] environments.

As the plugin requires Composer to work, direct calls need to be wired through a
project's `composer.json`.

This is done by adding a call to the `Plugin::run` function in the `script`
section of the `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "install-codestandards": [
            "Dealerdirect\\Composer\\Plugin\\Installers\\PHPCodeSniffer\\Plugin::run"
        ]
    }
}

```

The command can then be called using `composer run-script install-codestandards` or
referenced from other script configurations, as follows:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "install-codestandards": [
            "Dealerdirect\\Composer\\Plugin\\Installers\\PHPCodeSniffer\\Plugin::run"
        ],
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "@install-codestandards"
        ]
    }
}

```

For more details about Composer scripts, please refer to [the section on scripts
in the Composer manual][composer-manual-scripts].

### Changing the Coding Standards search depth

By default, this plugin searches up for Coding Standards up to three directories
deep. In most cases, this should be sufficient. However, this plugin allows
you to customize the search depth setting if needed.

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "phpcodesniffer-search-depth": 5
    }
}
```

### Caveats

When this plugin is installed globally, composer will load the _global_ plugin rather
than the one from the local repository. Despite [this behavior being documented
in the composer manual][using-composer-plugins], it could potentially confuse
as another version of the plugin could be run and not the one specified by the project.

## Developing Coding Standards

Coding standard can be developed normally, as documented by [PHP_CodeSniffer][codesniffer], in the [Coding Standard Tutorial][tutorial].

Create a composer package of your coding standard by adding a `composer.json` file.

```json
{
  "name" : "acme/phpcodesniffer-our-standards",
  "description" : "Package contains all coding standards of the Acme company",
  "require" : {
    "php" : ">=5.4.0,<8.0.0-dev",
    "squizlabs/php_codesniffer" : "^3.0"
  },
  "type" : "phpcodesniffer-standard"
}
```

Requirements:
* The repository may contain one or more standards.
* Each standard can have a separate directory no deeper than 3 levels from the repository root.
* The package `type` must be `phpcodesniffer-standard`. Without this, the plugin will not trigger.
