### Added
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.Classes.ForbiddenAbstractPrivateMethods` sniff to detect methods declared as both `private` as well as `abstract`. This was allowed between PHP 5.0.0 and 5.0.4, but disallowed in PHP 5.1 as the behaviour of `private` and `abstract` are mutually exclusive. [#822](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/822)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.Classes.NewTypedProperties` sniff to detect PHP 7.4 typed property declarations. [#801](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/801), [#829](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/829)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.Classes.RemovedOrphanedParent` sniff to detect the use of the `parent` keyword in classes without a parent (non-extended classes). This code pattern is deprecated in PHP 7.4 and will become a compile-error in PHP 8.0. [#818](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/818)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.FunctionDeclarations.NewExceptionsFromToString` sniff to detect throwing exceptions from `__toString()` methods. This would previously result in a fatal error, but will be allowed as of PHP 7.4. [#814](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/814)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.FunctionDeclarations.ForbiddenToStringParameters` sniff to detect `__toString()` function declarations expecting parameters. This was disallowed in PHP 5.3. [#815](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/815)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.MethodUse.ForbiddenToStringParameters` sniff to detect direct calls to `__toString()` magic methods passing parameters. This was disallowed in PHP 5.3. [#830](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/830)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.Operators.ChangedConcatOperatorPrecedence` sniff to detect code affected by the upcoming change in operator precedence for the concatenation operator. The concatenation operator precedence will be lowered in PHP 8.0, with deprecation notices for code affected being thrown in PHP 7.4. [#805](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/805)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.Operators.RemovedTernaryAssociativity` sniff to detect code relying on left-associativity of the ternary operator. This behaviour will be deprecated in PHP 7.4 and removed in PHP 8.0. [#810](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/810)
- :star2: New `PHPCompatibility.Syntax.NewArrayUnpacking` sniff to detect the use of the spread operator to unpack arrays when declaring a new array, as introduced in PHP 7.4. [#804](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/804)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.Classes.NewClasses` sniff: recognize the new `ReflectionReference` class as introduced in PHP 7.4. [#820](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/820)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.Constants.NewConstants` sniff: detection of the new PHP 7.4 Core (Standard), MBString, Socket and Tidy constants. [#821](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/821)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionUse.NewFunctions` sniff: detect usage of the new PHP 7.4 `get_mangled_object_vars()`, `mb_str_split()`, `openssl_x509_verify()`, `password_algos()`, `pcntl_unshare()`, `sapi_windows_set_ctrl_handler()` and `sapi_windows_generate_ctrl_event()` functions. [#811](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/811), [#819](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/819), [#827](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/827)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionUse.NewFunctions` sniff: recognize the new OCI functions as introduced in PHP 7.2.14 and PHP 7.3.1. [#786](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/786)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionUse.RemovedFunctions` sniff: recognize the PHP 7.4 deprecated `ldap_control_paged_result_response()` and `ldap_control_paged_result()` functions. [#831](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/831)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionUse.RemovedFunctions` sniff: recognize the `Payflow Pro/pfpro` functions as removed in PHP 5.1. [#823](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/823)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionUse.RequiredToOptionalFunctionParameters` sniff: account for the parameters for `array_merge()` and `array_merge_recursive()` becoming optional in PHP 7.4. [#817](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/817)
- :star: `PHPCompatibility.IniDirectives.RemovedIniDirectives` sniff: recognize the `Payflow Pro/pfpro` ini directives as removed in PHP 5.1. [#823](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/823)
- :star: Recognize the `interbase/Firebird` extension functionality which will be removed in PHP 7.4 (moved to PECL) in the `RemovedConstants`, `RemovedExtensions`, `RemovedFunctions` and `RemovedIniDirectives` sniffs. [#807](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/807)
- :star: Recognize the `wddx` extension functionality which will be removed in PHP 7.4 (moved to PECL) in the `RemovedExtensions` and `RemovedFunctions` sniffs. [#826](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/826)
- :star: New `isShortTernary()` and `isUnaryPlusMinus()` utility methods to the `PHPCompatibility\Sniff` class. [#810](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/810), [#805](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/805)

### Changed
- :pencil2: The `PHPCompatibility.Extensions.RemovedExtensions` sniff will now only report on the removed `Payflow Pro` extension when a function uses `pfpro_` as a prefix. Previously, it used the `pfpro` prefix (without underscore) for detection. [#812](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/812)
- :pencil2: The error message thrown when the `T_ELLIPSIS` token, i.e. the spread operator, is detected. [#803](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/803)
    PHP 7.4 adds a third use-case for the spread operator. The adjusted error message accounts for this.
- :umbrella: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionDeclarations.NewParamTypeDeclarations` is now also tested with parameters using the splat operator. [#802](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/802)
- :books: The documentation now uses the GitHub repo of `PHP_CodeSniffer` as the canonical entry point for `PHP_CodeSniffer`. Previously, it would point to the PEAR package. [#788](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/788)
- :books: The links in the changelog now all point to the `PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility` repo and no longer to the (deprecated) `wimg/PHPCompatibility` repo. [#828](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/828)
- :recycle: Various minor inline documentation improvements. [#825](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/825)
- :wrench: Various performance optimizations and code simplifications. [#783](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/783), [#784](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/784), [#795](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/795), [#813](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/813)
- :green_heart: Travis: build tests are now being run against PHP 7.4 (unstable) as well. [#790](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/790)
    Note: the builds are currently not (yet) tested against PHP 8.0 (unstable) as there is no compatible PHPUnit version available (yet).
- :wrench: Travis: The build script has been refactored to use [stages](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/) to get the most relevant results faster. Additionally some more tweaks have been made to improve and/or simplify the build script. [#798](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/798)
- :wrench: Build/PHPCS: warnings are no longer allowed for the PHPCompatibility native code. [#800](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/800)
- :wrench: Build/PHPCS: added variable assignment alignment check and file include check to the PHPCompatibility native CS configuration. [#824](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/824)
- :wrench: The minimum version for the recommended `DealerDirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer` Composer plugin has been upped to `0.5.0`. [#791](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/791)

### Fixed
- :bug: The `PHPCompatibility.Extensions.RemovedExtensions` sniff contained a typo in the alternative recommended for the removed `mcve` extension. [#806](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/806)
- :bug: The `PHPCompatibility.Extensions.RemovedExtensions` sniff listed the wrong removal version number for the `Payflow Pro/pfpro` extension (PHP 5.3 instead of the correct 5.1). [#823](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/823)

- :bug: `ReservedFunctionNames`: prevent duplicate errors being thrown for methods in nested anonymous classes. [#755](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/755)
- :bug: `PHPCSHelper::findEndOfStatement()`: minor bug fix. [#749](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/749)
- :bug: `Sniff::isClassProperty()`: class properties for classes nested in conditions or function calls were not always recognized as class properties. [#758](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/758)

## [9.0.0] - 2018-10-07

**IMPORTANT**: This release contains **breaking changes**. Please read the below information carefully before upgrading!

All sniffs have been placed in meaningful categories and a number of sniffs have been renamed to have more consistent, meaningful and future-proof names.

Both the `PHPCompatibilityJoomla` [[GH](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityJoomla) | [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-joomla)] as well as the `PHPCompatibilityWP` [[GH](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityWP)|[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-wp)] rulesets have already been adjusted for this change and have released a new version which is compatible with this version of PHPCompatibility.

Aside from those CMS-based rulesets, this project now also offers a number of polyfill-library specific rulesets, such as `PHPCompatibilityPasswordCompat` [[GH](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityPasswordCompat) | [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-passwordcompat)] for @ircmaxell's [`password_compat`](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat) libary, `PHPCompatibilityParagonieRandomCompat` and `PHPCompatibilityParagonieSodiumCompat` [[GH](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityParagonie)|[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-paragonie)] for the [Paragonie polyfills](https://github.com/paragonie?utf8=?&q=polyfill) and a number of rulesets related to various [polyfills offered by the Symfony project](https://github.com/symfony?utf8=?&q=polyfill) [[GH](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilitySymfony)|[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-symfony)].

If your project uses one of these polyfills, please consider using these special polyfill rulesets to prevent false positives.

Also as of this version, [Juliette Reinders Folmer] is now officially a co-maintainer of this package.

### Upgrade instructions

* If you have `<exclude name="..."/>` directives in your own project's custom ruleset which relate to sniffs from the PHPCompatibility library, you will need to update your ruleset to use the new sniff names.
* If you use the new [PHPCS 3.2+ inline annotations](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/releases/3.2.0), i.e. `// phpcs:ignore Standard.Category.SniffName`, in combination with PHPCompatibility sniff names, you will need to update these annotations.
* If you use neither of the above, you should be fine and upgrading should be painless.

- :books: A section about the new sniff naming conventions to the `Contributing` file. [#738](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/738)

### Changed
- :fire: All sniffs have been placed in meaningful categories and a number of sniffs have been renamed to have more consistent, meaningful and future-proof names. [#738](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/738). Fixes [#601](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/601), [#692](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/692)
    See the table at the top of this changelog for details of all the file renames.
- :umbrella: The unit test files have been moved about as well. [#738](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/738)
    * The directory structure for these now mirrors the default directory structure used by PHPCS itself.
    * The file names of the unit test files have been adjusted for the changes made in the sniffs.
    * The unit test case files have been renamed and moved to the same directory as the actual test file they apply to.
    * The `BaseSniffTest::sniffFile()` method has been adjusted to match. The signature of this method has changed. Where it previously expected a relative path to the unit test case file, it now expects an absolute path.
    * The unit tests for the utility methods in the `PHPCompatibility\Sniff` class have been moved to a new `PHPCompatibility\Util\Tests\Core` subdirectory.
    * The bootstrap file used for PHPUnit has been moved to the project root directory and renamed `phpunit-bootstrap.php`.
- :twisted_rightwards_arrows: The `PHPCompatibility.LanguageConstructs.NewLanguageConstructs` sniff has been split into two sniffs. [#738](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/738)
    The `PHPCompatibility.LanguageConstructs.NewLanguageConstructs` sniff now contains just the checks for the namespace separator and the ellipsis.
    The new `PHPCompatibility.Operators.NewOperators` sniff now contains the checks regarding the pow, pow equals, spaceship and coalesce (equals) operators.
- :pushpin: The `PHPCompatibility.ParameterValues.RemovedMbstringModifiers` sniff will now also recognize removed regex modifiers when used within a function call to one of the undocumented Mbstring function aliases for the Mbstring regex functions. [#715](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/715)
- :pushpin: The `PHPCompatibility\Sniff::getFunctionCallParameter()` utility method now allows for closures called via a variable. [#723](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/723)
- :pencil2: `PHPCompatibility.Upgrade.LowPHPCS`: the minimum supported PHPCS version is now 2.3.0. [#699](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/699)
- :pencil2: Minor inline documentation improvements. [#738](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/738)
- :umbrella: Minor improvements to the unit tests for the `PHPCompatibility.FunctionNameRestrctions.RemovedMagicAutoload` sniff. [#716](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/716)
- :recycle: Minor other optimizations. [#698](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/698), [#697](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/697)
- :wrench: Minor improvements to the build tools. [#701](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/701)
- :wrench: Removed some unnecessary inline annotations. [#700](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/700)
- :books: Replaced some of the badges in the Readme file. [#721](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/721), [#722](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/722)
- :books: Composer: updated the list of package authors. [#739](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/739)

### Removed
- :no_entry_sign: Support for PHP_CodeSniffer 1.x and low 2.x versions. The new minimum version of PHP_CodeSniffer to be able to use this library is 2.3.0. [#699](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/699). Fixes [#691](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/691).
    The minimum _recommended_ version of PHP_CodeSniffer remains the same, i.e. 2.6.0.
- :no_entry_sign: The `\PHPCompatibility\Sniff::inUseScope()` method has been removed as it is no longer needed now support for PHPCS 1.x has been dropped. [#699](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/699)
- :no_entry_sign: Composer: The `autoload` section has been removed from the `composer.json` file. [#738](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/738). Fixes [#568](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/568).
    Autoloading for this library is done via the PHP_CodeSniffer default mechanism, enhanced with our own autoloader, so the Composer autoloader shouldn't be needed and was causing issues in a particular use-case.

### Fixed
- :bug: `PHPCompatibility.FunctionUse.NewFunctionParameters` sniff: The new `$mode` parameter of the `php_uname()` function was added in PHP 4.3, not in PHP 7.0 as was previously being reported.
    The previous implementation of this check was based on an error in the PHP documentation. The error in the PHP documentation has been rectified and the sniff has followed suit. [#711](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/711)
- :bug: `PHPCompatibility.Generators.NewGeneratorReturn` sniff: The sniff would throw false positives for `return` statements in nested constructs and did not correctly detect the scope which should be examined. [#725](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/725). Fixes [#724](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/724).
- :bug: `PHPCompatibility.Keywords.NewKeywords` sniff: PHP magic constants are case _in_sensitive. This sniff now accounts for this. [#707](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/707)
- :bug: Various bugs in the `PHPCompatibility.Syntax.ForbiddenCallTimePassByReference` sniff [#723](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/723):
    - Closures called via a variable will now also be examined. (false negative)
    - References within arrays/closures passed as function call parameters would incorrectly trigger an error. (false positive)
- :green_heart: Compatibility with PHPUnit 7.2. [#712](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/712)

### Credits
Thanks go out to [Jonathan Champ] for his contribution to this version. :clap:


## [8.2.0] - 2018-07-17

See all related issues and PRs in the [8.2.0 milestone].

### Important changes

#### The repository has moved
As of July 13 2018, the PHPCompatibility repository has moved from the personal account of Wim Godden `wimg` to its own organization `PHPCompatibility`.
Composer users are advised to update their `composer.json`. The dependency is now called `phpcompatibility/php-compatibility`.

#### Framework/CMS specific PHPCompatibility rulesets
Within this new organization, hosting will be offered for framework/CMS specific PHPCompatibility rulesets.

The first two such repositories have been created and are now available for use:
* PHPCompatibilityJoomla [GitHub](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityJoomla)|[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-joomla)
* PHPCompatibilityWP [GitHub](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityWP)|[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-wp)

If you want to make sure you have all PHPCompatibility rulesets available at any time, you can use the PHPCompatibilityAll package [GitHub](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityAll)|[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-all).

For more information, see the [Readme](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility#using-a-frameworkcms-specific-ruleset) and [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#frameworkcms-specific-rulesets).

#### Changes expected in PHPCompatibility 9.0.0
The next version of PHPCompatibility will include a major directory layout restructuring which means that the sniff codes of all sniffs will change.

In this same release, support for PHP_CodeSniffer 1.5.x will be dropped. The new minimum supported PHPCS version will be 2.3.0.

For more information about these upcoming changes, please read the [announcement](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/688).

The `9.0.0` release is expected to be ready later this summer.

Related PRs: [#615](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/615), [#624](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/624), [#648](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/648), [#674](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/674), [#685](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/685), [#694](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/694). Related to issue [#530](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/530).
- :books: Readme: information about the PHPCS 3.3.0 change which allows for a `testVersion` in a custom ruleset to be overruled by the command-line. [#607](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/607)

### Changed
- :books: Adjusted references to the old repository location throughout the codebase to reflect the move to a GitHub organization. [#689](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/689)
    This repository will now live in [https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility) and the Packagist reference will now be `phpcompatibility/php-compatibility`.
- :white_check_mark: The `getReturnTypeHintToken()` utility method has been made compatible with the changes in the PHPCS tokenizer which were introduced in PHP_CodeSniffer 3.3.0. [#642](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/642). Fixes [#639](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/639).
- :pushpin: `ConstantArrayUsingConst`: improved handling of multi-constant declarations. [#593](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/593)

- :pushpin: The `findExtendedClassName()`, `findImplementedInterfaceNames()`, `getMethodParameters()` utility methods which are duplicates of upstream PHPCS methods, have been moved from the `PHPCompatibility\Sniff` class to the `PHPCompatibility\PHPCSHelper` class and have become static methods. [#613](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/613)
- :white_check_mark: `getReturnTypeHintToken()` utility method: align returned `$stackPtr` with native PHPCS behaviour by returning the last token of the type declaration. [#575](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/575)
- :white_check_mark: PHPCS cross-version compatibility: sync `getMethodParameters()` method with improved upstream version. [#643](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/643)
- :pencil2: The `MbstringReplaceEModifier`, `PregReplaceEModifier` and the `PregReplaceEModifier` sniffs now `extend` the new `AbstractFunctionCallParameterSniff` class. This should yield more accurate results when checking whether one of the target PHP functions was called. [#636](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/636)
- :pencil2: `DeprecatedNewReference` sniff: minor change to the error text and code - was `Forbidden`, now `Removed` -. Custom rulesets which explicitly excluded this error code will need to be updated. [#594](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/594)
- :pencil2: `NewScalarTypeDeclarations` sniff: minor change to the error message text.[#644](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/644)
- :umbrella: The unit test framework now allows for sniffs in categories other than `PHP`. [#634](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/634)
- :umbrella: Boyscouting: fixed up some (non-relevant) parse errors in a unit test case file. [#576](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/576)
- :green_heart: Travis: build tests are now also being run against the lowest supported PHPCS 3.x version. Previously only the highest supported PHPCS 3.x version was tested against. [#633](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/633)

- :wrench: Some code style clean up and start using the new inline PHPCS 3.2+ annotations where applicable. [#586](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/586), [#591](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/591), [#620](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/620), [#673](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/673)

### Removed
- :no_entry_sign: PHPCompatibility no longer explicitly supports PHP_CodeSniffer 2.2.0. [#687](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/687), [#690](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/690)
- :no_entry_sign: The PHPCompatibility ruleset no longer includes the PHPCS native `Generic.NamingConventions.CamelCapsFunctionName`. Double underscore prefixed function names are now being reported on by a new dedicated sniff. [#581](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/581)
- :no_entry_sign: PHPCompatibility no longer explicitly supports HHVM and builds are no longer tested against HHVM.
    For now, running PHPCompatibility on HHVM to test PHP code may still work for a little while, but HHVM has announced they are [dropping PHP support](https://hhvm.com/blog/2017/09/18/the-future-of-hhvm.html). [#623](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/623). Fixes [#603](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/603).
- :books: Readme: badges from services which are no longer supported or inaccurate. [#609](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/609), [#628](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/628)

### Fixed
- :bug: Previously, the PHPCS native `Generic.NamingConventions.CamelCapsFunctionName` sniff was included in PHPCompatibility. Some error codes of this sniff were excluded, as well as some error messages changed (via the ruleset).
    If/when PHPCompatibility would be used in combination with a code style-type ruleset, this could inadvertently lead to underreporting of issues which the CS-type ruleset intends to have reported - i.e. the error codes excluded by PHPCompatibility -. This has now been fixed. [#581](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/581)
- :bug: The `ForbiddenNegativeBitshift` sniff would incorrectly throw an error when a bitshift was based on a calculation which included a negative number, but would not necessarily result in a negative number. [#614](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/614). Fixes [#294](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/294), [#466](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/466).
- :bug: The `NewClosure` sniff would report the same issue twice when the issue was encountered in a nested closure. [#669](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/669)
- :bug: The `NewKeywords` sniff would underreport on non-lowercase keywords. [#627](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/627)
- :bug: The `NewKeywords` sniff would incorrectly report on the use of class constants and class properties using the same name as a keyword. [#627](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/627)
- :bug: The `NewNullableTypes` sniff would potentially underreport when comments where interspersed in the (return) type declarations. [#577](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/577)
- :bug: The `Sniff::getFunctionCallParameters()` utility method would in rare cases return incorrect results when it encountered a closure as a parameter. [#682](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/682)
- :bug: The `Sniff::getReturnTypeHintToken()` utility method would not always return a `$stackPtr`. [#645](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/645)
- :bug: Minor miscellanous other bugfixes. [#670](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/670)
- :umbrella: `PHPCompatibility\Tests\BaseClass\MethodTestFrame::getTargetToken()` could potentially not find the correct token to run a test against. [#588](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/588)

## [8.0.0] - 2017-08-03

**IMPORTANT**: This release contains a **breaking change**. Please read the below information carefully before upgrading!

The directory layout of the PHPCompatibility standard has been changed for improved compatibility with Composer.
This means that the PHPCompatibility standard no longer extends from the root directory of the repository, but now lives in its own subdirectory `/PHPCompatibility`.

This release also bring compatibility with PHPCS 3.x to the PHPCompatibility standard.

There are two things you will need to be aware of:
* The path to the PHPCompatibility standard has changed.
* If you intend to upgrade to PHPCS 3.x, the path to the `phpcs` script has changed (upstream change).

Please follow the below upgrade instructions carefully. This should be a one-time only action.

### Upgrade instructions

### Before upgrading

If you had previously made accommodations for the old directory layout, you should remove any such _"hacks"_ (meant in the kindest of ways) now.

By this we mean: symlinks for the PHPCompatibility install to the `PHP_CodeSniffer/CodeSniffer/Standards` directory, scripts to move the sniffs files to the PHPCS directory, scripts which made symlinks etc.

So, please remove those first.

> **Side-note**:
>
> If you had previously forked this repository to solve this issue, please consider reverting your fork to the official version or removing it all together.

### Upgrading: re-registering PHPCompatibility with PHP CodeSniffer

External PHP CodeSniffer standards need to be registered with PHP CodeSniffer. You have probably done this the first time you used PHPCompatibility or have a script or Composer plugin in place to do this for you.

As the directory layout of PHPCompatibility has changed, the path previously registered with PHP CodeSniffer will no longer work and running `phpcs -i` will **_not_** list PHPCompatibility as one of the registered standards.

#### Using a Composer plugin

If you use Composer, we recommend you use a Composer plugin to sort this out. In previous install instructions we recommended the SimplyAdmin plugin for this. This plugin has since been abandoned. We now recommend the DealerDirect plugin.
```bash
composer remove --dev simplyadmire/composer-plugins
composer require --dev dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer:^0.4.3
composer install
composer update phpcompatibility/php-compatibility squizlabs/php_codesniffer
vendor/bin/phpcs -i
```
If all went well, you should now see PHPCompatibility listed again in the list of installed standards.

#### Manually re-registering PHPCompatibility

1. First run `phpcs --config-show` to check which path(s) are currently registered with PHP CodeSniffer for external standards.
2. Check in the below table what the new path for PHPCompatibility will be - the path should point to the root directory of your PHPCompatibility install (not to the sub-directory of the same name):

    Install type | Old path | New path
    ------------ | -------- | ---------
    Composer     | `vendor/wimg` | `vendor/phpcompatibility/php-compatibility`
    Unzipped release to arbitrary directory | `path/to/dir/abovePHPCompatibility` | `path/to/dir/abovePHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility`
    Git checkout | `path/to/dir/abovePHPCompatibility` | `path/to/dir/abovePHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility`
    PEAR         | If the old install instruction has been followed, not registered. | `path/to/PHPCompatibility`
    
    > **Side-note**:
	>
	> If you used the old install instructions for a PEAR install, i.e. checking out the latest release to the `PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards/PHPCompatibility` directory, and you intend to upgrade to PHP CodeSniffer 3.x, it is recommended you move the PHPCompatibility folder out of the PEAR directory now, as the layout of the PHPCS directory has changed with PHPCS 3.x and you may otherwise lose your PHPCompatibility install when you upgrade PHP CodeSniffer via PEAR.

3. There are two ways in which you can register the new `installed_paths` value with PHP CodeSniffer. Choose your preferred method:
    * Run `phpcs --config-set installed_paths ...` and include all previously installed paths including the _adjusted_ path for the PHPCompatibility standard.

        For example, if the previous value of `installed_paths` was
		
		`/path/to/MyStandard,/path/to/dir/abovePHPCompatibility`

		you should now set it using

		`phpcs --config-set installed_paths /path/to/MyStandard,/path/to/PHPCompatibility`

    * If you use a custom ruleset in combination with PHPCS 2.6.0 or higher, you can pass the value to PHPCS from your custom ruleset:
        ```xml
        <config name="installed_paths" value="vendor/phpcompatibility/php-compatibility" />
        ```
4. Run `phpcs -i` to verify that the PHPCompatibility standard is now listed again in the list of installed standards.


### Upgrading to PHPCS 3.x

The path to the `phpcs` script has changed in PHPCS 3.x which will impact how you call PHPCS.

Version | PHPCS 2.x | PHPCS 3.x
------- | --------- | ---------
Generic `phpcs` Command | `path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/scripts/phpcs ....` | `path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/bin/phpcs ....`
Composer command | `vendor/bin/phpcs ...` | `vendor/bin/phpcs ...`

So, for Composer users, nothing changes. For everyone else, you may want to add the `path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/bin/phpcs` path to your PATH environment variable or adjust any scripts - like build scripts - which call PHPCS.


### Upgrading a Travis build script

If you run PHPCompatibility against your code as part of your Travis build:
* If you use Composer to install PHP CodeSniffer and PHPCompatibility on the travis image and you've made the above mentioned changes, your build should pass again.
* If you use `git clone` to install PHP CodeSniffer and PHPCompatibility on the travis image, your build will fail until you make the following changes:
    1. Check which branch of PHPCS is being checked out. If you previously fixed this to a pre-PHPCS 3.x branch or tag, you can now change this (back) to `master` or a PHPCS 3 tag.
    2. Check to which path PHPCompatibility is being cloned and adjust the path if necessary.
    3. Adjust the `phpcs --config-set installed_paths` command as described above to point to the root of the cloned PHPCompatibility repo.
    4. If you switched to using PHPCS 3.x, adjust the call to PHPCS.

- :pushpin: The `NewClasses` and `NewInterfaces` sniffs will now also report on new classes/interfaces when used as type hints. [#414](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/414), [#416](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/416). Fixes [#352](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/352)
- :pushpin: The `NewClasses` sniff will now also report on Exception classes when used in (multi-)`catch` statements. [#418](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/418). Fixes [#373](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/373).

- :bug: The `ForbiddenNames` sniff would only examine the first part of a namespace and not report on reserved keywords used in subsequent parts of a nested namespace. [#419](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/419)
- :bug: The `ForbiddenNames` sniff would not always correctly report on use statements importing constants or functions using reserved keywords. [#420](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/420)

## [7.1.3] - 2017-04-02

See all related issues and PRs in the [7.1.3 milestone].

### Added
- :zap: The `testVersion` config parameter now allows for specifying unbounded ranges.
    For example: specifying `-5.6` means: check for compatibility with all PHP versions up to and including PHP 5.6;
    Specifying `7.0-` means: check for compatibility with all PHP versions from PHP 7.0 upwards.
    For more information about setting the `testVersion`, see [Using the compatibility sniffs](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility#using-the-compatibility-sniffs) in the readme.
- :umbrella: Unit test for multi-line short arrays for the `ShortArray` sniff. [#347](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/347)
- :umbrella: Various additional unit tests against false positives. [#345](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/345), [#369](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/369)
- :umbrella: Unit tests for the `supportsBelow()`, `supportsAbove()` and `getTestVersion()` utility methods. [#363](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/363)
- :books: Readme: information about installation of the standard using git check-out. [#349](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/349)
- :books: `Contributing.md` file with information about reporting bugs, requesting features, making pull requests and running the unit tests. [#350](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/350)

### Changed
- :pushpin: The `ForbiddenFunctionParametersWithSameName`, `NewScalarTypeDeclarations`, `ParameterShadowSuperGlobals` sniff will now also sniff for and report violations in closures. [#331](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/331)
- :twisted_rightwards_arrows: :rewind: The check for the PHP 5.3 `nowdoc` structure has been moved from the `NewKeywords` sniff to a new stand-alone `NewNowdoc` sniff which will now also recognize this structure when the sniffs are run on PHP 5.2. [#335](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/335)
- :rewind: The `ForbiddenNames` sniff will now also correctly recognize reserved keywords used in a declared namespace when run on PHP 5.2. [#362](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/362)
- :recycle: Various (minor) refactoring for improved performance and sniff accuracy. [#360](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/360)
- :recycle: The unit tests would previously run each test case file against all PHPCompatibility sniffs. Now, they will only be tested against the sniff which the test case file is intended to test. This allows for more test cases to be tested, more precise testing in combination with `testVersion` settings and makes the unit tests run ~6 x faster.
    Relevant additional unit tests have been added and others adjusted. [#369](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/369)
- :recycle: Refactoring/tidying up of some unit test code. [#343](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/343), [#345](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/345), [#356](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/356), [#355](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/355), [#359](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/359)
- General housekeeping. [#346](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/346)
- :books: Readme: Clarify minimum requirements and influence on the results. [#348](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/348)

### Removed
- :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Removed the `LongArrays` sniff. The checks it contained have been moved into the `RemovedGlobalVariables` sniff. Both sniffs essentially did the same thing, just for different PHP native superglobals. [#354](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/354)

### Fixed
- :bug: The `PregReplaceEModifier` sniff would throw a false positive if a quote character was used as the regex delimiter. [#357](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/357)
- :bug: `RemovedGlobalVariables` sniff would report false positives for class properties shadowing the removed `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` variables. [#354](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/354).
- :bug: The `getFQClassNameFromNewToken()` utility function could go into an infinite loop causing PHP to run out of memory when examining unfinished code (examination during live coding). [#338](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/338), [#342](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/342)
- :bug: The `determineNamespace()` utility method would in certain cases not break out a loop. [#358](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/358)
- :wrench: Travis script: Minor tweak for PHP 5.2 compatibility. [#341](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/341)
- :wrench: The unit test suite is now also compatible with PHPUnit 6. [#365](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/365)
- :books: Readme: Typo in the composer instructions. [#344](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/344)

- :wrench: All unit tests now have appropriate `@group` annotations allowing for quicker/easier testing of a select group of tests/sniffs. [#305](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/305)
- :wrench: All unit tests now have appropriate `@covers` annotations to improve code coverage reporting and remove bleed through of accidental coverage. [#307](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/307)
- :wrench: Minor tweaks to the travis script. [#322](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/322)
- :green_heart: The PHPCompatibility code base itself will now be checked for cross-version compatibility during build testing. [#322](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/322)

### Fixed
- :bug: The `ConstantArraysUsingDefine` sniff would throw false positives if the value of the `define()` was retrieved via a function call and an array parameter was passed. [#327](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/327)
- :bug: The `ForbiddenCallTimePassByReference` sniff would throw false positives on assign by reference within function calls or conditions.

- :bug: The `NewNullableTypes` sniff would not report on nullable return types for namespaced classnames used as a type hint. [#323](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/323)
- :bug: The `PregReplaceEModifier` sniff would always consider the first parameter passed as a single regex, while it could also be an array of regexes. This led to false positives and potentially unreported use of the `e` modifier when an array of regexes was passed. [#300](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/300)
- :bug: The `PregReplaceEModifier` sniff could misidentify the regex delimiter when the regex to be examined was concatenated together from various text strings taken from a compound parameter leading to false positives. [#300](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/300)
- :white_check_mark: Compatibility with PHPCS 2.7.x. Deal with changed behaviour of the upstream PHP tokenizer and utility function(s). [#313](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/313), [#323](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/323), [#326](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/326), [#340](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/340)

## [7.1.0] - 2016-12-14

See all related issues and PRs in the [7.1.0 milestone].

### Added
- :star: New `stringToErrorCode()`, `arrayKeysToLowercase()` and `addMessage()` utility methods to the `PHPCompatibility_Sniff` class. [#291](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/291).

### Changed
- :pushpin: All sniff error messages now have modular error codes allowing for selectively disabling individual checks - and even selectively disabling individual sniff for specific files - without disabling the complete sniff. [#291](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/291)
- :pencil2: Minor changes to some of the error message texts for consistency across sniffs. [#291](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/291)

## [7.0.8] - 2016-10-31 - :ghost: Spooky! :jack_o_lantern:

See all related issues and PRs in the [7.0.8 milestone].

### Added
- :star2: New `ForbiddenNamesAsDeclared` sniff: detection of the [other reserved keywords](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.other-reserved-words.php) which are reserved as of PHP 7.0 (or higher). [#287](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/287). Fixes [#115](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/115).
    These were previously sniffed for by the `ForbiddenNames` and `ForbiddenNamesAsInvokedFunctions` sniffs causing false positives as the rules for their reservation are different from the rules for "normal" [reserved keywords](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.keywords.php).
- :star: New `inUseScope()` utility method to the `PHPCompatibility_Sniff` class which handles PHPCS cross-version compatibility when determining the scope of a `use` statement. [#271](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/271).
- :umbrella: More unit tests for the `ForbiddenNames` sniff. [#271](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/271).

### Changed
- :pushpin: _Deprecated_ functionality should throw a `warning`. _Removed_ or otherwise unavailable functionality should throw an `error`. This distinction was previously not consistently applied everywhere. [#286](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/286)
    This change affects the following sniffs:
    * `DeprecatedPHP4StyleConstructors` will now throw a `warning` instead of an `error` for deprecated PHP4 style class constructors.
    * `ForbiddenCallTimePassByReference` will now throw a `warning` if the `testVersion` is `5.3` and an `error` if the `testVersion` if `5.4` or higher.
    * `MbstringReplaceEModifier` will now throw a `warning` instead of an `error` for usage of the deprecated `e` modifier.
    * `PregReplaceEModifier` will now throw a `warning` if the `testVersion` is `5.5` or `5.6` and an `error` if the `testVersion` if `7.0` or higher. Fixes [#290](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/290).
    * `TernaryOperators` will now throw an `error` when the `testVersion` < `5.3` and the middle part has been omitted.
    * `ValidIntegers` will now throw a `warning` when an invalid binary integer is detected.
- :pencil2: `DeprecatedFunctions` and `DeprecatedIniDirectives` sniffs: minor change in the sniff error message text. Use _"removed"_ rather than the ominous _"forbidden"_. [#285](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/285)
    Also updated relevant internal variable names and documentation to match.

### Fixed
- :bug: `ForbiddenNames` sniff would throw false positives for `use` statements which changed the visibility of methods in traits. [#271](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/271).
- :bug: `ForbiddenNames` sniff would not report reserved keywords when used in combination with `use function` or `use const`. [#271](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/271).
- :bug: `ForbiddenNames` sniff would potentially - unintentionally - skip over tokens, thereby - potentially - not reporting all errors. [#271](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/271).
- :wrench: Composer config: `prefer-stable` should be a root element of the json file. Fixes [#277](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/277).

[#181](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/181), [#182](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/182), [#166](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/166), [#167](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/167), [#172](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/172), [#180](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/180), [#146](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/146), [#138](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/138)
- :recycle: Various refactoring to remove code duplication in the unit tests and add proper test skip notifications where relevant. [#139](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/139), [#149](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/149)

### Fixed
- :bug: The `DeprecatedFunctions` sniff was reporting an incorrect deprecation/removal version number for a few functions. [#149](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/149)
- :bug: The `DeprecatedIniDirectives` sniff was in select cases reporting deprecation of an ini directive prior to removal, while the ini directive was never deprecated prior to its removal. [#146](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/146)
- :bug: The `DeprecatedPHP4StyleConstructors` sniff would cause false positives for methods with the same name as the class in namespaced classes. [#167](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/167)
- :bug: The `ForbiddenEmptyListAssignment` sniff did not report errors when there were only comments or parentheses between the list parentheses. [#166](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/166)
- :bug: The `ForbiddenEmptyListAssignment` sniff will no longer cause false positives during live coding. [#166](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/166)
- :bug: The `NewClasses` sniff would potentially misidentify namespaced classes as PHP native classes. [#161](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/162)
- :bug: The `NewFunctions` sniff would fail to identify called functions when the function call was not lowercase. [#161](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/161)
- :bug: The `NewFunctions` sniff would potentially misidentify namespaced userland functions as new functions. [#161](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/161)
- :bug: The `NewIniDirectives` sniff was reporting an incorrect introduction version number for a few ini directives. [#146](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/146)
- :bug: `NewKeywords` sniff: the use of the `const` keyword should only be reported when used outside of a class for PHP < 5.3. [#147](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/147). Fixes [#129](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/129).
- :bug: The `RemovedExtensions` sniff was incorrectly reporting a number of extensions as being removed in PHP 5.3 while they were actually removed in PHP 5.1. [#156](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/156)
- :bug: :recycle: The `NewFunctionParameters` and `RemovedFunctionParameters` now use the new `doesFunctionCallHaveParameters()` and `getFunctionCallParameterCount()` utility methods for improved accuracy in identifying function parameters. This fixes several false positives. [#153](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/153) Fixes [#120](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/120), [#151](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/151), [#152](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/152).
- :bug: A number of sniffs would return `false` if the examined construct was not found. This could potentially cause race conditions/infinite sniff loops. [#138](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/138)
- :wrench: The unit tests would fail to run when used in combination with a PEAR install of PHPCS. [#157](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/157).
- :green_heart: Unit tests failing against PHPCS 2.6.1. [#158](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/158)
    The unit tests *will* still fail against PHPCS 2.6.2 due to a bug in PHPCS itself. This bug does not affect the running of the sniffs outside of a unit test context.

## [7.0.2] - 2016-08-03

See all related issues and PRs in the [7.0.2 milestone].

### Added
- :star: `RemovedExtensions` sniff: ability to whitelist userland functions for which the function prefix overlaps with a prefix of a deprecated/removed extension. [#130](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/130). Fixes [#123](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/123).
    To use this feature, add the `functionWhitelist` property in your custom ruleset. For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility#phpcompatibility-specific-options).

### Changed
- :pencil2: A number of sniffs contained `public` class properties. Within PHPCS, `public` properties can be overruled via a custom ruleset. This was not the intention, so the visibility of these properties has been changed to `protected`. [#135](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/135)
- :wrench: Composer config: Stable packages are preferred over unstable/dev.
- :pencil2: Ruleset name. [#134](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/134)

## [7.0.1] - 2016-08-02

See all related issues and PRs in the [7.0.1 milestone].

### Changed
- :pushpin: The `DeprecatedIniDirectives` sniff used to throw an `error` when a deprecated ini directive was used in combination with `ini_get()`. It will now throw a `warning` instead. [#122](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/122) Fixes [#119](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/119).
    Usage of deprecated ini directives in combination with `ini_set()` will still throw an `error`.
- :pushpin: The `PregReplaceEModifier` sniff now also detects the `e` modifier when used with the `preg_filter()` function. While this is undocumented, the `e` modifier was supported by the `preg_filter()` function as well. [#128](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/128)
- :pencil2: The `RemovedExtensions` sniff contained superfluous deprecation information in the error message. [#131](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/131)

### Removed
- :wrench: Duplicate builds from the Travis CI build matrix. [#132](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/132)

### Fixed
- :bug: The `ForbiddenNames` sniff did not allow for the PHP 5.6 `use function ...` and `use const ...` syntax. [#126](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/126) Fixes [#124](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/124).
- :bug: The `NewClasses` sniff failed to detect new classes when the class was instantiated without parenthesis, i.e. `new NewClass;`. [#121](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/121)
- :bug: The `PregReplaceEModifier` sniff failed to detect the `e` modifier when using bracket delimiters for the regex other than the `{}` brackets. [#128](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/128)
- :green_heart: Unit tests failing against PHPCS 2.6.1.

[#77](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/77)
- :books: Readme: Composer installation instructions. [#32](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/32), [#61](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/pull/61)
