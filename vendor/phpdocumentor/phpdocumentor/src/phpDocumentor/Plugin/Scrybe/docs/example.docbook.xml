            QueryPath is a library designed to help you quickly and efficiently search,
            modify, and traverse XML and HTML documents. It is built on an interface with
            functions similar to what is found in {@link
            <a href="http://jquery.com" title="http://jquery.com">http://jquery.com</a>
            jQuery}. However,
            it is optimized for server-side work.
