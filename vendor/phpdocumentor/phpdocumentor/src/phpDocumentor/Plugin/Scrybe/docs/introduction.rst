Introduction
============

Scrybe is a toolkit that can be used to generate any type of hand-written
document, booklet or even complete books.

Scrybe is inspired by Sphinx but aims to help authors by allowing a variety of
input formats; such as Markdown, Restructured Text and more are coming in the
future.

Scrybe aims to be an application to write:

* Reference documentation for Development
* Articles for publication in your favourite format
* Books and booklets

But it is also intended to help you create documentation stemming from different
sources (such as multiple sub-modules).
