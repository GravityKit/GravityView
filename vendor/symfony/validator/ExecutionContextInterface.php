/**
 * Stores the validator's state during validation.
 *
 * For example, let's validate the following object graph:
 *
 *     (Person)---($firstName: string)
 *          \
 *       ($address: Address)---($street: string)
 *
 * We validate the <tt>Person</tt> instance, which becomes the "root" of the
 * validation run (see {@link getRoot}). The state of the context after the
 * first step will be like this:
 *
 *     (Person)---($firstName: string)
 *        ^ \
 *       ($address: Address)---($street: string)
 *
 * The validator is stopped at the <tt>Person</tt> node, both the root and the
 * value (see {@link getValue}) of the context point to the <tt>Person</tt>
 * instance. The property path is empty at this point (see {@link getPropertyPath}).
 * The metadata of the context is the metadata of the <tt>Person</tt> node
 * (see {@link getMetadata}).
 *
 * After advancing to the property <tt>$firstName</tt> of the <tt>Person</tt>
 * instance, the state of the context looks like this:
 *
 *     (Person)---($firstName: string)
 *          \              ^
 *       ($address: Address)---($street: string)
 *
 * The validator is stopped at the property <tt>$firstName</tt>. The root still
 * points to the <tt>Person</tt> instance, because this is where the validation
 * started. The property path is now "firstName" and the current value is the
 * value of that property.
 *
 * After advancing to the <tt>$address</tt> property and then to the
 * <tt>$street</tt> property of the <tt>Address</tt> instance, the context state
 * looks like this:
 *
 *     (Person)---($firstName: string)
 *          \
 *       ($address: Address)---($street: string)
 *                                   ^
 *
 * The validator is stopped at the property <tt>$street</tt>. The root still
 * points to the <tt>Person</tt> instance, but the property path is now
 * "address.street" and the validated value is the value of that property.
 *
 * Apart from the root, the property path and the currently validated value,
 * the execution context also knows the metadata of the current node (see
 * {@link getMetadata}) which for example returns a {@link Mapping\PropertyMetadata}
 * or a {@link Mapping\ClassMetadata} object. he context also contains the
 * validation group that is currently being validated (see {@link getGroup}) and
 * the violations that happened up until now (see {@link getViolations}).
 *
 * Apart from reading the execution context, you can also use
 * {@link addViolation} or {@link addViolationAt} to add new violations and
 * {@link validate} or {@link validateValue} to validate values that the
 * validator otherwise would not reach.
