When Chuck's magnificent lead sperm cannoned into Cindy's womb it went straight to one of her ovaries and roared, \"Which one of you servile wenches thinks you can handle getting split open by the Chuck!?\" All of the eggs cowered in the corner. The same thing happened at the other ovary. \"I didn't fucking think so!\" shouted the lead sperm which then lead the rest of the troops back into Chuck's balls. Chuck pulled out; roundhouse kicked Cindy in the face and told her, \"Don't ever waste my time again.\""

Chuck Norris then threw his packed wallet at the remains of his victim and said \"Do not tap on my shoulders ever again\", and continued to walk home slowly."
