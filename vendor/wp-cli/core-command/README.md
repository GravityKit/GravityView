~~~
wp core download [<download-url>] [--path=<path>] [--locale=<locale>] [--version=<version>] [--skip-content] [--force] [--insecure]
~~~

Downloads and extracts WordPress core files to the specified path. Uses
current directory when no path is specified. Downloaded build is verified
to have the correct md5 and then cached to the local filesytem.
Subsequent uses of command will use the local cache if it still exists.

**OPTIONS**

		Download directly from a provided URL instead of fetching the URL from the wordpress.org servers.

	[--path=<path>]
		Specify the path in which to install WordPress. Defaults to current
		directory.

	[--locale=<locale>]
		Select which language you want to download.

	[--version=<version>]
		Select which version you want to download. Accepts a version number, 'latest' or 'nightly'.

	[--skip-content]
		Download WP without the default themes and plugins.

	[--force]
		Overwrites existing files, if present.

	[--insecure]
		Retry download without certificate validation if TLS handshake fails. Note: This makes the request vulnerable to a MITM attack.

**EXAMPLES**

    $ wp core download --locale=nl_NL
    Downloading WordPress 4.5.2 (nl_NL)...
    md5 hash verified: c5366d05b521831dd0b29dfc386e56a5

### wp core install

Runs the standard WordPress installation process.

~~~
wp core install --url=<url> --title=<site-title> --admin_user=<username> [--admin_password=<password>] --admin_email=<email> [--skip-email]
~~~

Creates the WordPress tables in the database using the URL, title, and
default admin user details provided. Performs the famous 5 minute install
in seconds or less.

Note: if you've installed WordPress in a subdirectory, then you'll need
to `wp option update siteurl` after `wp core install`. For instance, if
WordPress is installed in the `/wp` directory and your domain is example.com,
then you'll need to run `wp option update siteurl http://example.com/wp` for
your WordPress installation to function properly.

Note: When using custom user tables (e.g. `CUSTOM_USER_TABLE`), the admin
email and password are ignored if the user_login already exists. If the
user_login doesn't exist, a new user will be created.

**OPTIONS**

	--url=<url>
		The address of the new site.

	--title=<site-title>
		The title of the new site.

	--admin_user=<username>
		The name of the admin user.

	[--admin_password=<password>]
		The password for the admin user. Defaults to randomly generated string.

	--admin_email=<email>
		The email address for the admin user.

	[--skip-email]
		Don't send an email notification to the new admin user.

**EXAMPLES**

    # Install WordPress in 5 seconds
    $ wp core install --url=example.com --title=Example --admin_user=supervisor --admin_password=strongpassword --admin_email=info@example.com
    Success: WordPress installed successfully.

    # Install WordPress without disclosing admin_password to bash history
    $ wp core install --url=example.com --title=Example --admin_user=supervisor --admin_email=info@example.com --prompt=admin_password < admin_password.txt



### wp core is-installed

Checks if WordPress is installed.

~~~
wp core is-installed [--network]
~~~

Determines whether WordPress is installed by checking if the standard
database tables are installed. Doesn't produce output; uses exit codes
to communicate whether WordPress is installed.

	[--network]
		Check if this is a multisite installation.

**EXAMPLES**

    # Check whether WordPress is installed; exit status 0 if installed, otherwise 1
    $ wp core is-installed
    $ echo $?
    1

    # Bash script for checking whether WordPress is installed or not
    if ! wp core is-installed; then
        wp core install
    fi

    Added multisite constants to wp-config.php.
    Success: Network installed. Don't forget to set up rewrite rules.

wp core multisite-install [--url=<url>] [--base=<url-path>] [--subdomains] --title=<site-title> --admin_user=<username> [--admin_password=<password>] --admin_email=<email> [--skip-email] [--skip-config]
~~~

Creates the WordPress tables in the database using the URL, title, and
