WP-CLI
======

[WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) is the command-line interface for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). You can update plugins, configure multisite installations and much more, without using a web browser.

Ongoing maintenance is made possible by:

## Using

WP-CLI provides a command-line interface for many actions you might perform in the WordPress admin. For instance, `wp plugin install --activate` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/)) lets you install and activate a WordPress plugin:

```bash
$ wp plugin install user-switching --activate
Installing User Switching (1.0.9)
Downloading installation package from https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/user-switching.1.0.9.zip...
Unpacking the package...
Installing the plugin...
Plugin installed successfully.
Activating 'user-switching'...
Plugin 'user-switching' activated.
Success: Installed 1 of 1 plugins.
```

WP-CLI also includes commands for many things you can't do in the WordPress admin. For example, `wp transient delete --all` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/transient/delete/)) lets you delete one or all transients:

```bash
$ wp transient delete --all
Success: 34 transients deleted from the database.
```

For a more complete introduction to using WP-CLI, read the [Quick Start guide](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/quick-start/). Or, catch up with [shell friends](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/shell-friends/) to learn about helpful command line utilities.

Already feel comfortable with the basics? Jump into the [complete list of commands](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/) for detailed information on managing themes and plugins, importing and exporting data, performing database search-replace operations and more.

## Installing

Downloading the Phar file is our recommended installation method for most users. Should you need, see also our documentation on [alternative installation methods](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/) ([Composer](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-composer), [Homebrew](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-homebrew), [Docker](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-docker)).

Before installing WP-CLI, please make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:

- UNIX-like environment (OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin); limited support in Windows environment
- PHP 5.4 or later
- WordPress 3.7 or later. Versions older than the latest WordPress release may have degraded functionality

Once you've verified requirements, download the [wp-cli.phar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar) file using `wget` or `curl`:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

Next, check the Phar file to verify that it's working:

```bash
php wp-cli.phar --info
```

To use WP-CLI from the command line by typing `wp`, make the file executable and move it to somewhere in your PATH. For example:

```bash
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```

If WP-CLI was installed successfully, you should see something like this when you run `wp --info`:

```bash
$ wp --info
OS:	Darwin 16.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jan 11 22:59:40 PST 2018; root:xnu-3789.73.8~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
Shell:	/bin/zsh
PHP binary:    /usr/local/bin/php
PHP version:    7.0.22
php.ini used:   /etc/local/etc/php/7.0/php.ini
WP-CLI root dir:        /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli
WP-CLI vendor dir:	    /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/vendor
WP-CLI packages dir:    /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/packages/
WP-CLI global config:   /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/config.yml
WP-CLI project config:
WP-CLI version: 2.4.0
```

### Updating

You can update WP-CLI with `wp cli update` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/cli/update/)), or by repeating the installation steps.

If WP-CLI is owned by root or another system user, you'll need to run `sudo wp cli update`.

Want to live life on the edge? Run `wp cli update --nightly` to use the latest nightly build of WP-CLI. The nightly build is more or less stable enough for you to use in your development environment, and always includes the latest and greatest WP-CLI features.

### Tab completions

WP-CLI also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [wp-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/v2.4.0/utils/wp-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash
```

Don't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.

If using zsh for your shell, you may need to load and start `bashcompinit` before sourcing. Put the following in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash
```

## Support

WP-CLI's maintainers and contributors have limited availability to address general support questions. The [current version of WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/roadmap/) is the only officially supported version.

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [Common issues and their fixes](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/common-issues/)
* [WP-CLI handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/)
* [Open or closed issues in the WP-CLI GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+org%3Awp-cli+is%3Aissue)
* [Threads tagged 'WP-CLI' in the WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic-tag/wp-cli/)
* [Questions tagged 'WP-CLI' in the WordPress StackExchange](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli)

If you didn't find an answer in one of the venues above, you can:

* Join the `#cli` channel in the [WordPress.org Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to chat with whomever might be available at the time. This option is best for quick questions.
* [Post a new thread](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/wp-advanced/#new-post) in the WordPress.org support forum and tag it 'WP-CLI' so it's seen by the community.

GitHub issues are meant for tracking enhancements to and bugs of existing commands, not general support. Before submitting a bug report, please [review our best practices](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/bug-reports/) to help ensure your issue is addressed in a timely manner.

Please do not ask support questions on Twitter. Twitter isn't an acceptable venue for support because: 1) it's hard to hold conversations in under 280 characters, and 2) Twitter isn't a place where someone with your same question can search for an answer in a prior conversation.

Remember, libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful, and set your expectations accordingly.

## Extending

A **command** is the atomic unit of WP-CLI functionality. `wp plugin install` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/)) is one command. `wp plugin activate` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/activate/)) is another.

WP-CLI supports registering any callable class, function, or closure as a command. It reads usage details from the callback's PHPdoc. `WP_CLI::add_command()` ([doc](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/internal-api/wp-cli-add-command/)) is used for both internal and third-party command registration.

```php
/**
 * Delete an option from the database.
 *
 * Returns an error if the option didn't exist.
 *
 * ## OPTIONS
 *
 * <key>
 * : Key for the option.
 *
 * ## EXAMPLES
 *
 *     $ wp option delete my_option
 *     Success: Deleted 'my_option' option.
 */
$delete_option_cmd = function( $args ) {
	list( $key ) = $args;

	if ( ! delete_option( $key ) ) {
		WP_CLI::error( "Could not delete '$key' option. Does it exist?" );
	} else {
		WP_CLI::success( "Deleted '$key' option." );
	}
};
WP_CLI::add_command( 'option delete', $delete_option_cmd );
```

WP-CLI comes with dozens of commands. It's easier than it looks to create a custom WP-CLI command. Read the [commands cookbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/commands-cookbook/) to learn more. Browse the [internal API docs](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/internal-api/) to discover a variety of helpful functions you can use in your custom WP-CLI command.
