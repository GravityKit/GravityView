Contributing
============

Welcome and thanks!

We appreciate you taking the initiative to contribute to WP-CLI. It’s because of you, and the community around you, that WP-CLI is such a great project.

**Contributing isn’t limited to just code.** We encourage you to contribute in the way that best fits your abilities, by writing tutorials, giving a demo at your local meetup, helping other users with their support questions, or revising our documentation.

Read through our [contributing guidelines in the handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/contributing/) for a thorough introduction to how you can get involved. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of other contributors on the project. In turn, they’ll do their best to reciprocate that respect when working with you, across timezones and around the world.
