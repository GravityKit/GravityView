## Using

This package implements the following commands:

### wp package

Lists, installs, and removes WP-CLI packages.

~~~
wp package
~~~

WP-CLI packages are community-maintained projects built on WP-CLI. They can
contain WP-CLI commands, but they can also just extend WP-CLI in some way.

Learn how to create your own command from the
[Commands Cookbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/commands-cookbook/)

Although the package index will remain in place for backward compatibility reasons, it has been
deprecated and will not be updated further. Please refer to https://github.com/wp-cli/ideas/issues/51
to read about its potential replacement.

**OPTIONS**

	[--fields=<fields>]
		Limit the output to specific fields. Defaults to all fields.

	[--format=<format>]

		---
		default: table
		options:

		  - csv
		  - ids
		  - json
		  - yaml
		---

**AVAILABLE FIELDS**

These fields will be displayed by default for each package:

### wp package install

Installs a WP-CLI package.

~~~
wp package install <name|git|path|zip> [--insecure]
~~~

Packages are required to be a valid Composer package, and can be
specified as:

* Package name from WP-CLI's package index.
* Git URL accessible by the current shell user.
* Path to a directory on the local machine.
* Local or remote .zip file.

Packages are installed to `~/.wp-cli/packages/` by default. Use the
`WP_CLI_PACKAGES_DIR` environment variable to provide a custom path.

When installing a local directory, WP-CLI simply registers a
reference to the directory. If you move or delete the directory, WP-CLI's
reference breaks.

When installing a .zip file, WP-CLI extracts the package to
`~/.wp-cli/packages/local/<package-name>`.

**OPTIONS**

	<name|git|path|zip>
		Name, git URL, directory path, or .zip file for the package to install.
		Names can optionally include a version constraint
		(e.g. wp-cli/server-command:@stable).

	[--insecure]
		Retry downloads without certificate validation if TLS handshake fails. Note: This makes the request vulnerable to a MITM attack.

**EXAMPLES**

    # Install a package hosted at a git URL.
    $ wp package install runcommand/hook

    # Install the latest stable version.
    $ wp package install wp-cli/server-command:@stable

    # Install a package hosted at a GitLab.com URL.
    $ wp package install https://gitlab.com/foo/wp-cli-bar-command.git

    # Install a package in a .zip file.
    $ wp package install google-sitemap-generator-cli.zip



### wp package list

~~~
wp package list [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>]

**OPTIONS**

	[--fields=<fields>]
		Limit the output to specific fields. Defaults to all fields.

	[--format=<format>]
		Render output in a particular format.
