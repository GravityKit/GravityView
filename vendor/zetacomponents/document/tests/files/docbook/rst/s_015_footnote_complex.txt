[#]_ will be \"2\" \(manually numbered\), [#]_ will be \"3\" \(anonymous
auto-numbered\), and [#]_ will be \"1\" \(labeled auto-numbered\).

.. [#] This footnote is labeled manually, so its number is fixed.

.. [#] This footnote will be labeled \"3\". It is the second auto-numbered
   footnote, but footnote label \"2\" is already used.

.. [#] This autonumber-labeled footnote will be labeled \"1\". It is the first
   auto-numbered footnote and no other footnote with label \"1\" exists. The
   order of the footnotes is used to determine numbering, not the order of the
   footnote references.
