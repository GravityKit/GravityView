==== Literal blocks ====

Literal blocks may be created just by indentation:

  Like this.

They may be multi-line:

  Foo.
  Bar

Markup is ignored inside:

  **foo** http://example.org ... [[ / &%/

Additional indentation is also ignored:

  Foo
    Bar
   If you want to preserve indenation, use <code>
  Blubb.
