DokuWiki supports multiple ways of creating links. External links are
recognized automagically: http://www.google.com or simply www.google.com - You
can set link text as well: [[http://www.google.com|This Link points to
google]]. Email addresses like this one: <andi@splitbrain.org> are recognized,
too.
