Full BBCode example

For example using stacked lists:

[list=1]
[*]Go to the shops
[*]
    [list]
    [*] This is second level list item
    [*] This is another one
    [/list]
[*]Swear at [b]computer [i]when[/i][/b] it crashes
[/list]

Whereas for an [url=http://example.com]alphabetical list[/url] you would use:

[code]
Some code
  maintaining
    spaces
[/code]

This was a literal block, while this is an [code]inline literal[/code].
