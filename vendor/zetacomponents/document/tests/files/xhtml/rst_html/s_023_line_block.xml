      <literallayout class="normal">This is a line block. It ends with a blank line. 
 New lines begin with a vertical bar ("|"). 
 Line breaks and initial indent are significant, and preserved. 
 Continuation lines are also possible. A long line that is intended to wrap should begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
