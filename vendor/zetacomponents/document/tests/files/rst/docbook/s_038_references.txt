I will be manning `eZ systems'`_ booth to answer questions and demo eZ publish
to the attendees.

Our book `"PHP 5 Power Programming"`_ is now available free of charge as part
of the `Bruce Perens' Open Source Series`_ under the OPL. Enjoy! If you like
it, consider buying the book to award it's authors though.
