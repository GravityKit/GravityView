=================

.. |reST| replace:: reStructuredText

Yes, |reST| is a long word, so I can't blame anyone for wanting to

As reStructuredText doesn't support nested inline markup, the only way to
create a reference with styled text is to use substitutions with the "replace"
directive:

I recommend you try |Python|_.

.. |Python| replace:: Python, *the* best language around
.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
