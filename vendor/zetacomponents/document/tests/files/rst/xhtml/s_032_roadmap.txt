eZ Components 2008.2
====================

*Expected release date:* End of 2008

Mission
-------

In this release our main focus is to add MVC support to the eZ Components.
Besides this main focus, we will also enhance some of the critical components
that the upcoming version of `eZ Publish`_ will require.

.. _`eZ Publish`: http://ez.no/ezpublish

New components
--------------

We are planning the following new components:

MvcTools
~~~~~~~~

Where most frameworks dedicate a specific router, controller and view, the
MVC implementation in eZ Components will only consist of very loosely based
parts. For each of the specific parts of MVC we will provide one or more
default implementations, as well as detailed information on how to write
your own implementations of a Model, View and Controller. Of course most
of those implementations will be done through Tie-in components.


Enhancing existing components
-----------------------------

Additionally, the existing components will be improved further. 
Major parts here are the following:

Developer Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A configuration switch in the Base component that all other components will
  use as well. The switch switches between "development mode", where all the
  possible checks are being made; and "production mode", where as many 
  safety checks are omitted to increase performance.

Document
~~~~~~~~

- More supported formats, such as the `eZ Publish`_ format, writing ReST_
  files, reading XHTML files and wiki formats.

.. _ReST: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html

WebDav
~~~~~~

- Support for authentication and locking. (ie. Make it work with Finder_).

.. _Finder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)

Template
~~~~~~~~

- Updated contexts_ support to allow for proper JavaScript escaping.
