eZ Components - Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Group and setting identifiers can only contain the characters a to z, A to Z, 0
to 9, underscore (_), dash (-) and dot (.). The case of settings are preserved,
but accessing them can be done with any case. This means that you cannot have two
identical settings identifiers that differ only in case.
