====================
Document conversions
====================

This document aims to document a list of semantic markup elements, which can
not be converted into one or another markup language, so you have to expect
loss in the semantic document information during conversions.

Source RST
==========

Conversion loss, when the source is a RST document.

Docbook
-------

- Strong emphasis

  There is no strong emphasis markup in Docbook, so we use <emphasis
  role="strong"/> for this, while the role may be lost during further
  conversions.

- Table colspan

  Table colspan are available in Docbook, but the markup is rather unintuitive
  and hard to read. These information may be lost during further conversions.

- Footnote enumeration

  In docbook footnote do not have any user assigned enumeration, while in RST
  there may be multiple footnotes with the same (labeled) user assigned
  number. This information is completely lost during conversion.

- Substitutions
  
  The substitution references are not preserved, but just substituted during
  the conversion process. The information about the parts which were
  substituted is completely lost.

- Line blocks / literal blocks
 
  Line blocks and literal blocks are converted to <literalblock> elements,
  only differing by the given class attribute.

- Bullet list tokens

  The information which kind of bullet list token has been used is completely
  omitted during the conversion.

XHTML
-----

- Headers
 
  XHtml only allows a specification of header levels from 1 to 6. All headers
  with a depth of â‰¥ 6 contain a class attribute specifying their real depth.

- Blockquote annotations

  There is no XHtml element for blockquote annotations, so that they are
  transformed to <div class="annotation"/> elements containing <cite>
  elements, which may be considered as a citation source. This information may
  be lost during further processing. The cite attribute of blockquotes only
  accept URIs. 

- Bullet list & ordered list types

  XHtml strict does not allow to specify the type of bullet lists or ordered
  lists, so that this information is lost during conversion.

- Footnotes

  There is no dedicated XHtml element for footnotes, so that footnotes are
  referenced inside the text by internal links with the class "footnote", and
  the actual footnotes are added below the document in lists of the class
  footnote with the proper reference targets.

- Line blocks

  Line blocks are transformed into paragraphs, where the lines are seperated
  by <br /> elements. This causes the right formatting, but may lose semantic
  information.
