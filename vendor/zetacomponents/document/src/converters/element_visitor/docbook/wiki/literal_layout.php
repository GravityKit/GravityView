/**
 * Visit literallayout elements
 *
 * Literallayout elements are used for code blocks in docbook, where
 * normally some fixed width font is used, but also for poems or simliarly
 * formatted texts. In HTML those are represented by entirely different
 * structures. Code blocks will be transformed into <pre> elements, while
 * poem like texts will be handled by a <p> element, in which each line is
 * seperated by <br> elements.
